# Work-Day-Scheduler

The purpose of this project was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by
modifying starter HTML and CSS code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

In this project I learned how to apply third party API methods into my script file. One method that was solidified was the use of moment.js library.
As always these projects push me to do my research and look at helpful documentation.
